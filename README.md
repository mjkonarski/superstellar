Massive multiplayer galactic game written in Golang. It has been inspired by the old arcade space shooter called Asteroids.

## Live demo

## Rules
Destroy moving objects and don’t get killed by other players and asteroids. You’ve got two resources – health points and energy points. You lose your health with every hit you get and every contact with the asteroid. Energy points are consumed when shooting and using a boost drive. The more objects you kill, the bigger your health bar grows. Good luck

## Story behind the game
[https://medium.com/u2i-blogs/we-made-a-multiplayer-browser-game-in-go-for-fun-242a5990ce29](https://medium.com/u2i-blogs/we-made-a-multiplayer-browser-game-in-go-for-fun-242a5990ce29)

## Installation & running
1. Clone this repository to your `$GOPATH/src` directory
1. `cd` to that directory
2. Run `go get`
3. Run `go build && go install`
4. Run `$GOPATH/bin/superstellar` to run a server instance
5. Open new console and go to the game source directory.
6. `cd webroot`
7. `npm install`
8. `npm run dev`
9. Go to [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)

## Running stress test util
You can run a stress test util that spawns any number of clients which connect to the server and send ramdomly correct user input messages.

1. `cd superstellar_utils`
1. `go build && go install`
1. Run `$GOPATH/bin/superstellar_utils 127.0.0.1 100 50ms` for spawning 100 clients, with 50 ms interval.

## Live profiling 
It's possible to dump various information from the running server, e.g. stacktraces of all goroutines which might be useful in case of a deadlock. 

1. Run server
1. Go to [http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/](http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/)

## Using JS `__DEBUG__` flag

If you run `DEBUG=true npm run dev` you will see additional debugging
informations. You can add your own debugging info in code. Just detect that
we're in the debug mode:

```javascript
if (__DEBUG__) {
   console.log("I'm in debug mode!");
}
```

## Compiling protobufs

Run `./generateProto.sh`
